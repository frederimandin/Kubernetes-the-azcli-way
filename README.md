# Kubernetes-the-azcli-way
Derived from https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/ to use Azure and Azure CLI.

This project will host the necessary modifications to Kelsey Hightower's guide to build Kubernetes from scratch. He used Google Cloud Platform, where I am using Microsoft Azure.

Most of the setup is the same, hust some command lines changed.

First step is just to store the list of the commands I am building right now, and then to find a way to integrate that with Kelsey's guide.
